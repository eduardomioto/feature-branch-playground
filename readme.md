# Git Playground: Understanding Git Concepts, Feature Branching, and Rebasing  

Welcome to the **Git Playground** repository! This project is designed as a hands-on environment to help you explore and practice key Git concepts like feature branching and rebasing. Whether you're new to Git or looking to refine your skills, this repository provides a safe space for experimentation and learning.

## Features  

1. **Feature Branching**:  
   Learn how to create, switch, and work with feature branches to maintain a clean and organized development workflow.  

2. **Rebasing**:  
   Master rebasing techniques to rewrite commit history, keep your branches updated, and maintain a linear project history.  

3. **Git Concepts**:  
   Understand and practice fundamental Git commands like `add`, `commit`, `merge`, `log`, `revert`, and more.

cd git-playground
```

## Exercises  

### 1. Setting Up a Feature Branch  
- Create a new feature branch from `main`:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Make changes, stage, and commit them:  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add your feature description"
  ```
- Push your feature branch to the remote repository:  
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 2. Rebasing Your Feature Branch  
- Fetch the latest changes on `main`:  
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git checkout main
  git pull
  ```
- Rebase your feature branch onto the updated `main`:  
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/your-feature-name
  git rebase main
  ```
- Resolve conflicts if needed, then continue the rebase:  
  ```bash
  git rebase --continue
  ```

### 3. Merging and Squashing Commits  
- Merge your feature branch into `main` with a merge commit:  
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Alternatively, squash commits during the merge to keep the history clean:  
  ```bash
  git merge --squash feature/your-feature-name
  ```

## Repository Structure  
- **main**: The primary branch representing the latest stable state of the project.  
- **feature/**: Prefix for feature-specific branches (e.g., `feature/add-login`).  
- **playground/**: Optional branches to test Git commands and scenarios.
